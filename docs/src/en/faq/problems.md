## If the Preview is not displayed or is displayed as a blank page 

- check that the mandatory metadata have been filled in (title and author)&nbsp;;
- check that all BibTex keys are correct and complete.

## If the bibliography is not completely displayed in the preview window

- check that the _Display_ option in the _Bibliography_ section of the metadata pane is set to “All citations” mode.

## Recover account access in the event of a problem

If your account is on Huma-Num, you can recover access to your account by clicking on “reset my password”. Your Huma-Num account is affiliated with a specific email address that cannot be changed. However, you can manually transfer content from one account to another by “sharing” it and re-inviting yourself to the workspaces, by creating another Huma-Num account with your new email address. 

## I've created two accounts (one local and one remote, with two different e-mail addresses).

It's up to you to decide which account to use, depending on whether you want to make your account and its content interoperable with the rest of Huma Num's services or not (we therefore recommend that you use your Huma Num account instead).

## I have Ancient Greek in my article and I'd like it to display well in the export

If you have ancient Greek in your article and would like it to be displayed in the export (in HTML, PDF, etc.), in the metadata, activate the YAML option (top right) and directly enter either `mainfont : Old Standard`, or `fontfamily : Old Standard`. This will modify the entire typography of your article; in the near future, it will be possible to specify this font only for the text sections concerned, by means of a specific markup.
