In this section you will find use-cases of Stylo in the form of explanatory videos or "scenarios", for many of its practices. We produced a translation of the captions in English out of the automatically generated ones (you can find them by clicking on the "cc" button, and then on the "settings" button). If you are having trouble adopting Stylo, you will probably find some guidance in this section!
