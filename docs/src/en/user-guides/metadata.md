title: "Manage my metadata"

As we saw earlier, the metadata of documents created in Stylo are serialized in YAML.
YAML is a plain text format used to describe data explicitly, based on the [key : value] principle.
For more information on this subject, see the [relevant section](/en/yamlsyntax).

The metadata for each article is visible from the editing interface, in the pane on the right-hand side of the interface.

The [Metadata] button opens the metadata pane. Three editing modes are available:

1. **Basic Mode**: for editing basic metadata: title, subtitle, abstracts, authors and keywords;
2. **Editor Mode**: allows you to edit all metadata relating to a scholarly journal: article identifier, dossier information, review information, journal categories and keywords, etc. ..;
3. **Raw Mode**: an advanced-user editing space that lets you modify input fields directly in the YAML format structure.

**Important**: in order to export an article, the "Title" and "Authors" fields must be filled in.

**Please note**: in the metadata pane, you'll find the "Bibliography" division, where the *Display* option lets you choose whether to view the entire bibliography ("All citations") or only those references that have been cited in the body of the article ("Only used").
