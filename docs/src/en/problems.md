## Solving known problems

### If the preview does not appear or appears as a blank page:
- Check that the mandatory metadata is filled in (title and author)
- Check that the BibTex keys are correct and complete

### If the bibliography does not appear completely in the preview
- Check that the *Display* option, which is in the *Bibliography* section of the metadata pane, is in "All citations" mode

For all other issues, do not hesitate to contact us during helpdesk hours: Thursday morning from 11am to 12pm (Montr√©al time) [here](https://meet.jit.si/stylo).
