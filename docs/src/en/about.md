title: "About _Stylo_"
---

Stylo is a semantic text editor for scientific publishing in the humanities and social sciences, led by the [Canada Research Chair in Digital Writing](https://www.ecrituresnumeriques.ca/en) team, and licensed under [GPL-3.0](https://github.com/EcrituresNumeriques/stylo/blob/master/LICENSE).

## About

More than a tool, Stylo is a philosophy of text. It's based on the idea that we need to design textual models and digital environments adapted for writing in the Humanities and Social Sciences (SHS). 

Adapted for SHS journals, Stylo is a prototype tool, a research project in development implemented in the editorial chain of [Sens Public](https://sens-public.org/), [Lampadaire](https://lampadaire.ca/), [Imaginations](https://imaginationsjournal.ca/index.php/imaginations), and others. It was designed and developed as part of the partnership project [Revue 2.0](http://revue20.org/), and continues to be tested and improved through the [Revue 3.0 project](https://revue30.org/en). 

Stylo is also used by various authors and students on a personal basis, for their scientific or institutional work. 

This instance of Stylo is deployed and maintained by [Huma-Num](https://www.huma-num.fr/), which ensures data backup and security. Stylo's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EcrituresNumeriques/stylo/).

## Stylo-sophy

Prototypical of a reflexive approach to digital textuality, Stylo encourages the development of critical literacy, through active interaction with open source languages and technologies adapted to scholarly writing, evaluation and publication.

Originally, Stylo was a text editor designed to transform and integrate the entire digital editorial chain of scholarly journals in the humanities and social sciences. Based on the idea of separating the semantic markup and graphical displays of a document, Stylo allows the author to focus on the meaning of the text as it is being written, rather than on its formatting.

Today, Stylo offers a free, collaborative solution, based on open standards (Markdown, YAML, BibTeX), enabling multiple outputs (PDF, HTML, XML-TEI, TEI Commons Publishing, ODT) from a single document or corpus - facilitating document circulation outside the proprietary formats, environments and servers of the big Sillicon Valley groups.
