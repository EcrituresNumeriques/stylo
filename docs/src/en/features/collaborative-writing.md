## Prerequisites for collaborative writing

Collaborative writing allows several users to write synchronously or asynchronously in an article on Stylo.
This feature is similar to that found in other applications such as [Hedgedoc](https://hedgedoc.org/) or Google Docs.

Unlike these applications, where sharing a simple URL is enough to grant writing rights to a document, Stylo requires users to authenticate themselves in order to obtain this right.

Furthermore, users wishing to write to a Stylo article must have access to the article to be edited. 
To give other users access rights to an article, 2 alternatives are possible:

- [share an article](/en/features/myarticles/#share-an-article)
- access an article in a [workspace](/en/features/workspaces/).

## Collaborative article writing

With the new version of Stylo, you no longer need to launch a collaborative writing session. The process has been greatly simplified.

If you want to work on an article at the same time as a collaborator, all you have to do is click on the article's edit button. Of course, all collaborators must have access to the article, either from their personal space or from a workspace (see above).
