title: Share and annotate an article
---

The article's share and annotate public link (though not indexed by search engines) remains the same for the life of the article. If the article is modified, this link will show the latest version of the article (remember to refresh the page to see the modifications).

**Note:** In order to annotate an article, you must first create a Hypothesis account. If you haven't already, you can do so [here](https://hypothes.is/signup).

From the shareable Stylo article annotation page, you can annotate and view your collaborators' annotations.

To create this annotation page, click on “Annotate”. The annotations will apply to the entire article: they will be visible in every editable version. However, as the article is subject to change, it may happen that annotations lose their anchors (following the deletion of portions of text to which they were linked) and find themselves moved elsewhere in the article or orphaned.

It is also possible to generate a link for sharing and annotating a specific version of the article. When you're on the chosen version of your document, you can generate this link by adding `/preview` to the URL.

To annotate the article, select the part of the text you wish to comment: an annotation icon will appear! [Annotation icon](/uploads/images/refonte_doc/Hypothesis.png). You can either highlight it (*Highlight*) or annotate it (*Annotate*), the former highlighting privately by default. The annotation can be private (“Post to Only me”), public (“Post to Public”) or visible to other Hypothesis users with access to the Hypothesis annotation group.
