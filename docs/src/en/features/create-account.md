title: “Create an account”
---

From the Stylo home page, you have two options for creating an account: a local account on Stylo or an account via the Huma-num authentication service.

We suggest you create an account with Huma-Num, so you'll have access to other tools hosted by this platform. You'll also be able to retrieve your password if you forget it, which is not possible with a local account on Stylo.

If you already have a Stylo or Huma-Num account, log in [here](https://stylo.huma-num.fr/).

By creating an account, you'll gain access to a personal space where you can store and manage your articles. 

To create an account, start by clicking on the red button [Create a Huma-Num account]. This will take you to a page like this one:

Simply enter your surname, first name and e-mail address. You must then accept the terms of use and enter the correct data in the Captcha. 

You will then receive a confirmation e-mail. Confirm your e-mail address.

You will then be able to log in to your personal workspace in Stylo!
