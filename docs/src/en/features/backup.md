Title: "Backing up your data"
---

Stylo is not a data hosting service. It is important to regularly back up your documents on Stylo, especially sensitive or important data for a research group.

Currently, you can back up your data by grouping important/sensitive articles from a personal or shared workspace into a corpus, then exporting the corpus's source files (Markdown for the text, YAML for the metadata, and BibTeX for the bibliographic references). 

Soon, it will be possible to export all your data from Stylo in batches, making it easier for users to do so.
