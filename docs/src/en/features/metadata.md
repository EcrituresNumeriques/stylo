title: "Managing metadata"
---

Metadata for documents created in Stylo are serialized in YAML. This is a plain text format that allows data to be described explicitly on a `[key : value]` basis.

The metadata for each item is visible in the pane on the right-hand side of the interface, 
in the corresponding section.

You can edit your metadata by entering information in the appropriate boxes or, by activating the raw YAML mode in the top right-hand corner, you can fill in your metadata directly in YAML.

*For more information on how to manage your metadata, please refer to the YAML section of "Tutorials".*.
