Stylo is a projet under development managed by the team of the [Research Laboratory on Digital Textualities](https://www.ecrituresnumeriques.ca/fr).

If you are a journal that would like to use Stylo in your editorial chain, please contact the team directly at <contact@ecrituresnumeriques.ca>. We take into consideration specific requests to adapt Stylo to particular needs and practices.

If you are experiencing problems with Stylo, or would like to exchange ideas with the community, report needs or even share practices with others, you can do so on [the Stylo community forum](https://discussions.revue30.org/c/stylo/5).

Finally, for more personalized support, we have a permanent office open every Thursday from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (Montreal time)&nbsp;:
