Stylo is developed by the team at the [Canada Research Chair in Digital Textualities](https://ecrituresnumeriques.ca/en/Team) and *PiNinja* company.

For more information, you can contact us at the [Chair's email address](mailto:crc.ecrituresnumeriques@gmail.com).

For questions and discussion about Stylo, a helpdesk is open every Thursday morning from 11am to 12pm (Canadian time):

by videoconference</link-button>

We do consider specific requests that Stylo be adapted to particular editorial chains - like a journal, for example

It is possible to report problems and bugs on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EcrituresNumeriques/stylo/issues).
