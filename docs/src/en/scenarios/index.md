In this section you will find use-cases of Stylo in the form of explanatory videos or "scenarios", for many of its practices. We produced a translation of the captions in English out of the automatically generated ones (you can find them by clicking on the "cc" button, and then on the "settings" button). If you are having trouble adopting Stylo, you will probably find some guidance in this section!  

Here is a complete list of our scenarios currently available&nbsp;:

- Create a Huma-Num account for Stylo
- Personalize your writing in Stylo with Monaco
- Make versions of a document in Stylo
- Annotate Stylo articles in a collaborative way
- Manage bibliographic references in Stylo
- Export an article or a corpus of articles from Stylo
