# Managing references

Bibliographic references are managed in BibTex format. The references
can be generated from a bibliographic management tool like Zotero,
Endnote or another.

It is also possible to synchronise article references with a sub-folder
(a collection) from a public Zotero group, by filling in the sub-folder
user.

1. In the left panel, select "Bibliography" then "Manage
Bibliography"
2. Follow the instructions to important your bibliography from Zotero:
select the group user, followed by collections, then the user and the
sub-collection. Example: 322999/collections/5MJ6MP6P.
3. Click on "Save Zotero link and fetch"
4. Your bibliographic references must appear in the left panel under
"bibliography"

Some frequent errors to avoid: your group must be public; the group user
and the sub-collection user must be separated by /collections/.

## General scenarios

1. If you would like to cite the author + the year and the page in
brackets:

|Display in Atom | Definitive display
|:--|:--|
|`Real space, that of our material life,`<br/>`and cyber space (which is
certainly `<br/>` not completely virtual) must not `<br/>` be referred to using separate `<br/>`
monikers because they intermingle more `<br/>` and more solidly
[@shirky_here_2008, p. 194]. `|` Real space, that of our material
life, `<br/>` and cyber space (which is certainly `<br/>` not completely virtual) must
not be referred to using separate`<br/>`monikers because they intermingle more
and more solidly (Shirky 2008, 194).`| 

2. If the author's name already appears, and you would like to simply
add the publication year in brackets:

|Display in Atom | Definitive display
|:--|:--|
|`Clay @shirky_here_2008[p. 194] has suggested that real space, `<br/>` that
of our material life, and `<br/>` cyber space (which is certainly not completely
`<br/>` virtual) must not be referred to using separate monikers because they
intermingle `<br/>` more and more solidly.` | `Clay Shirky (2008, 194), has
suggested that real space, `<br/>` that of our material life, `<br/>` and cyber space
(which is certainly not completely `<br/>` virtual) must not be referred to
using separate `<br/>` monikers because they intermingle `<br/>` more and more solidly.`|

3. In order to avoid repeating a name, and to reference just the years,
put a - before the key:

|Display in Atom | Definitive display
|:--|:--|
|` Conceptual artists have sought `<br/>` (apparently without great success nor `<br/>`
huge conviction if we believe `<br/>` Lucy Lippard [-@lippard_six_1973 ;
-@lippard_get_1984]) `<br/>` to undermine art market rules.` | `Conceptual
artists have sought `<br/>` (apparently without great success nor huge
conviction if we believe `<br/>` Lucy Lippard (1973 ; 1984)) `<br/>` to undermine art
market rules.`|
