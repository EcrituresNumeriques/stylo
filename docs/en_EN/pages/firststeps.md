# First steps with Stylo

## Creating an account

To use Stylo, creating a user account is necessary. To create an
account, please click [here](https://front.stylo.ecrituresnumeriques.ca/register) and fill in the mandatory fields:

![Register](uploads/images/Register.png)

If you already have an account, [sign-in here].

## User page

The home page for your Stylo account lists your personal articles as
well as those that have been shared with you by other Stylo users.

By default, a first article, called \"How to Stylo\", appears on the
platform, and it details each step involved with writing an article. Do
not hesitate to refer to this page if you would like to write your
article directly in Stylo, or if you have questions on the articles that
require special treatment (illustrations, etc.).

For each article, many actions are possible:

|Button|Function|
|:-:|:--|
| ![Edit](uploads/images/Edit.png) | To open the article and edit|
| ![Share](uploads/images/Share.png) | To share the article and its version history with
another Stylo user. It will be called: "[Copy] New article"|
| ![Duplicate](uploads/images/Duplicate.png) | To duplicate only the last version of the article|
| ![Rename](uploads/images/Rename.png) | To rename the article|
| ![Plus](uploads/images/plus.png) | To expand other functions relating to the article|
|| ![Versions](uploads/images/Version.png) To consult the history of saved versions|
|| ![Tag](uploads/images/Tag.png) To fill in the article tags by clicking on "edit"|
|| ![Delete](uploads/images/Delete.png) To delete the article|

Note: The document name, as it is visible in Stylo, does not correspond
to the title of the article that will be generated.

**Careful:** Deleting an article is irreversible. If the article is shared
with another user, it will remain available for this user even after it
is deleted.

## Understand the article structure

An article in Stylo is made up of the following three separate elements:

-   The text body
-   Metadata
-   A bibliography

Stylo offers an integrated interface to edit each of these elements,
whose sources are accessible at any time via the export module.

## Editing interface

The article editing interface offers many modules:

-   A text body: a space to edit the body of the article's text.
-   A metadata manager: a space to edit information concerning the
    article (summary, author, key words, publication date, etc.)
-   A version manager: a space that saves and renames minor and major
    versions (*Save Minor* and *Save Major*), that accesses successive
    versions to consult, export and compare them with other versions.
-   A bibliography manager: a space to edit references (cited and not
    cited in the text body).
-   A content table: automatically presenting a summary of the article,
    based on the titles within the text body).

-   A statistic tool: presenting statistical information on the article
    (word and character count, etc.).

![Schéma de l'interface d'édition de Stylo](uploads/images/Structure.png)

## Share option

The [Share] function allows you to invite co-authors to work on the
same article. These users then have access to the entire history. The
article versions will synchronise for all the users as changes are made
to the document.

**Careful:** Sharing an article with another user is possible only by
entering the email address that the other user entered to create their
Stylo account.

## New article

Click on the "Create a new article" button (you must enter the title
of the article in the appropriate field, then click again on the
"Create" button).

To create a new article, you must click on the button:

![Nouvel article](uploads/images/Create.png)

You must then enter the name of the document in the appropriate field

![nommer un article](uploads/images/Title.png)

and validate the operation by once again clicking on the button

![Nouvel article](uploads/images/Create.png)

During this process, you can also add tags to the article by clicking on
the button

![Add Tags](uploads/images/AddTag.png)

The article will then appear in your list of articles. Click on the
button

![edit](uploads/images/Edit.png)

to access the editing space and begin to work on your article.

## Import

If the content that you intended to edit is already structured in
another format, in another space, it is possible to transfer it into the
Stylo editing space. Stylo essentially edits Markdown language
(extension .md): to import content currently in DOC format (extension
.doc) or DOCX (extension .docx), we have put in place an online
converter, which allows you to convert a docx document to md. The
procedure is detailed in the conversion page.

![Import](uploads/images/Import.png)

Once you have converted, an md. document is generated: open it with a
text editor (Atom, GeDit), and copy/paste the document content into the
space of your Stylo article.

## Editing

The editing environment is made up of 5 modules:

-   In the centre: the space for writing intended for the body of the
    article text
-   To the right: the \[Metadata\] button opens the metadata editor
-   To the left:
    -   History of document versions to navigate and interact with
        different saved versions
    -   The *Table of contents* lists the titles at 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^,
        etc. levels.
    -   The *Bibliography* lists the bibliographic references
    -   The *Stats* offer some quantitative data for the article

## Writing in Markdown

The Stylo article must be writing in Markdown language, an easy to learn
markup language.

Markdown language allows a syntax structure that is easy to both read
and write. Here are the main writing rules for Markdown:

-   Title: the levels of the title (level 1 for the title of the
    article, level 2 for the titles of the section, etc.) are organised
    using \"\#\", like this:
    -   \# title of the article, \#\# Introduction, etc.

Careful: the body of the article text does not support titles for level
1; titles for level 1 are only used for the *Title* fields in the
metadata.

-   Italics: italics can be created in two ways: \_word\_ or \*word\*
-   Bold: bold can be created like this: \*\*word\*\*
-   Long citation: long citations are created like this: \>long citation
-   Footnote: a footnote can be created with or without a number
    -   With a number:
    
```
Here is my text [^1]

[^1]: a footnote with a number and reference
```

-   Without a number:

```
Here is my text^[inline footnote.]
```

To improve your knowledge in Markdown syntax, you can see this page.

## Versions

![active](uploads/images/NomVersion.png)

A document version corresponds to saving your work. A version always
contains the following article elements: metadata, bibliography, text
body. Therefore, in changing the old version, each of these three
elements are updated.

Your work is automatically saved by Stylo. However, you can -- and we do
advise this -- use the saving functions to *Save Minor* or *Save Major*
versions by naming each. A minor version corresponds to minor changes,
whereas a major version creates a version with the most important
changes.

This way, when you have created a version that you are satisfied with,
you can make a title of your version in the field *Version label* before
saving it as a minor or major version.

At all times, you can view your work. That is, you can view both the
current version that you are in the process of working on and the
preceding version, by clicking on the \[Preview\] button:

![Preview](uploads/images/Preview.png)

Each version contains many functions:

-   For the editable version (*Edition*):

|Button|Function|
|:-:|:--|
| ![Save Major](uploads/images/Major.png) | To save a major version of your work|
| ![Save Minor](uploads/images/Minor.png) | To save a minor version of your work|
| ![Export](uploads/images/ExportE.png) |  To export and save the version in different formats|
| ![Preview](uploads/images/Preview.png) | To access the preview of your work and annotate it|

-   For a previous version

    -   \[Compare\] to compare different versions (a previous version
        and the current version or two previous versions). For more
        information of the \[Compare\] function, you can consult this
        page.

    -   \<!\--image\--\>: to export and download the document in
        different formats: HTML5, XML érudit, etc.

    -   \[Preview\] to access a preview of your work and to annotate it.
        For more information on the \[Preview\] function, you can see
        this page.

To view a previous version, you must click on its title. To return to
the editable version, you must click on the \[Edit\] button.

## Export

The export module offers many formats (HTML5, XML, PDF, etc.), allowing
you to choose a bibliographic style, and the inclusion or not of a
content table.

For more information on Stylo exporting, you can see this page.

## Summary

![sommaire](uploads/images/sommaire.png)

The summary appears in a list of titles at levels 1, 2, and so on. These
titles are clickable, for quick access to that part of the corresponding
text.

## Bibliography

The bibliography lists the bibliographic references that you have added.
The bibliographic references can be added either one by one, or grouped.
To add your reference, you must click on \[Manage Bibliography\] in the
left pane: the Bibliography tool then opens and offers you a number of
possibilities:

1\. Zotero: you can synchronise your bibliography using a Zotero folder
(the folder must be public) by entering the folder URL.

2\. Citations: you can manually fill in your bibliography using BibTex
format.

3\. Raw BibTex: to edit the BibTex

You can directly structure your references in BibTex, or export your
references in BibTex thanks to your bibliography management tools:

-   See tutorials: Zotero, Mendeley

To add a reference to the article, you just need to click on the
reference, then paste (Ctrl+V) the reference in the desired place of the
text. This way, a click is the same as \"copying\" the reference key to
the clipboard. Then, you just need to paste it into the text body.

![biblioex](uploads/images/biblioex.png)

For more information on managing the bibliography, you can see this
page.

## Metadata

![metadata](uploads/images/metadata.png)

The \[Metadata\] button allows you to open the metadata pane. Three
editing modes are available:

1\. Basic Mode: allows editing the basic metadata: Title, subtitle,
summaries, authors and keywords.

2\. Editor Mode: allows editing all metadata relating to a scholarly
journal: identifying an article, folder information, evaluation
information, journal categories, journal keywords, etc.

3\. Raw Mode: an editing space for an advanced user, where you can modify
fields directly in yaml structure.

Important: in order to export an article, these fields must be filled
in:

-   A title

-   An author name.

For more information on metadata editing, you can see this page.

Careful: in the metadata pane is the \"Bibliography\" division,
including the *Display* option, which allows you to choose to view the
bibliography either in its entirety (\"All citations\"), or just the
references which have been cited in the body of the article (\"Only
used\").

![All citation](uploads/images/allCitation.png)

## Statistics

![statistiques](uploads/images/statistiques.png)

The *Stats* menu provides information on:

-   The number of words

-   The number of characters, without spaces

-   The number of characters, with spaces

-   The number of citations

## Annotation

There are two annotation possibilities:

1\. Annotate a version

2\. Annotate the article

To annotate a version, click on the version number you want to annotate
and then click \[preview\]. A preview of the article in HTML will open
with the annotation tool *Hypothes.is* on the right.

![Hypothes.is](uploads/images/Hypothesis.png)

Important: If you annotate a version, your annotation will not be
visible on the other version.

To annotate the article, click \[Edit\] and then \[Preview\]. The
annotations will relate to the article. However, given that the editable
version is subject to changes, annotations can no longer be anchored in
the correct parts of the text (which could have been deleted or moved).
